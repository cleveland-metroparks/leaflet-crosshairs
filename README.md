No no no, read _me_.

See the hosted example here:

The problem space is this: Your web development team is good with forms. They build forms like diurnal animals sleep -- daily, day in, day out, day in, day out. So, they want to build a form for a mobile web app _and_ it just happens to use HTML5 to grab the geolocation from field deployed phones, tablets, etc.. Great! Geo problem solved -- when we collect our form data, we'll get geo-data _for free_.

Not so fast, form-building cow-poke -- what's the quality of those data? How accurate is that phone GPS? Is it good _enough_. The answer probably is _yes, most of the time_.

Most of the time isn't good enough, Faye. What I want is an embedded map where I can move the crosshairs to the actual location inside the form. Simple.
